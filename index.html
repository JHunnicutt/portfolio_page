I would develop a page for a fake product titled "BOOK." The satire would be directed at our relience on our multiple devices in order to derive entertaiment. The company in question would be using this page to unveil a revolutionary new product, one comprised of paper pages and doesn't require power. This one was fun for me to put together. I've very proud of the logo that I designed for this.</p>

This requries an understanding of metal tolerances; how much metal must be inbetween each cut and what is the least amount of shapes you need in order to convey the original image. This is both a challenging and rewarding process as there have been many desings that I didn't think were possible until I worked at them awhile. I showcase more of my work here on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/aechcutt" target="_blank">Instagram</a> page.</p>
